## Features
- **Grade Calculation**: Computes average scores for students based on their assignments or exams.
- **Letter Grade Assignment**: Converts numerical scores into letter grades (e.g., A, B, C) based on a grading scale.
- **Student Management**: Stores and manages student information and their respective grades.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Interacts with users through a command-line interface for inputting and viewing grades.

## Project Structure
The project is organized under the `src/main` directory with the following key components:

- **java/**
  - `GradeCalculator.java`: Contains the logic for calculating averages and determining letter grades.
  - `Student.java`: Defines the `Student` class to store student details and scores.
  - `Main.java`: Entry point of the application, handling user input and orchestrating the program flow.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Maven**: For dependen


cy management and building the project.
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) to compile and run the Java code.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hilal-Anwar/GradedClasses.git
   cd GradedClasses
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Source Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/main
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
   If using Maven, ensure you have a `pom.xml` file in the root directory. If not, you can compile manually:
   ```bash
   javac java/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java -cp java Main
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running the `Main` class.
2. Follow the command-line prompts to:
   - Enter student details (e.g., name, ID).
   - Input scores for assignments or exams.
   - View calculated averages and letter grades.
3. The program will display the results, including each student's average score and corresponding letter grade.

Example interaction:
```
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter student ID: 12345
Enter scores (separated by spaces): 85 90 78
Average: 84.33
Grade: B
```
